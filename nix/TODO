* patch:
  - code in next release will have moved to
    src/libexpr/primops/fetchTree.cc , check if <sys/wait.h> is still
    required.

* port to NetBSD?
  There is a high probability that in addition to packaging, supported platforms
  must be tested and non-supported (like NetBSD host) ported to.
