Doxy2man takes the XML generated by Doxygen as input and creates several
man pages from that. It creates a summary man page for a header and for
each function a detailed man page. The output is optimized for C
projects.

It supports the most common doxygen features, e.g. implicit and explicit
see also tags, copyright, author information, brief and detailed
descriptions, etc.
