Weak Signal Communication Software

WSJT-X, WSJT, MAP65, and WSPR are open-source programs designed for
weak-signal digital communication by amateur radio.  Normal usage
requires a standard SSB transceiver and a personal computer with
soundcard, or the equivalent.  SDR-style hardware including the
SDR-IQ, Perseus, SoftRock, and FUNcube Dongle is supported by MAP65
and WSPR.  SimJT is a utility program that generates simulated signals
for test purposes.  All of the programs are available free of charge,
licensed under the GNU General Public License.  Installation packages
for WSJT-X are available for Windows, Linux, and OS X; WSJT and WSPR
have Windows and Linux packages, and MAP65 and SimJT are Windows only.
For further details about source code and operating systems, see the
Program Development page.
