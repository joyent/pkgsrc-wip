Zeek is a passive, open-source network traffic analyzer. Many
operators use Zeek as a network security monitor (NSM) to support
investigations of suspicious or malicious activity. Zeek also supports
a wide range of traffic analysis tasks beyond the security domain,
including performance measurement and troubleshooting.
