libXaw3dXft is an extended version of libXaw3d, developed as part of xpaint
with support for UTF-8 input and UTF-8 encoding of text, and rendering text
with the FreeType library and TrueType fonts.

It should be mostly compatible with the original Xaw3d library, except for font
management: everything using the old X11 core font routines should be replaced
by their FreeType equivalents.
